<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">We fought all the time.  People
said that's just what brothers do.  Except that there was nothing
normal about the way Monkey and I fought.  He knew the exact places
to cause the worst kind of pain.  I knew his old injuries.  I kicked
the crook behind his right knee, and he snarled.  It was an old wound
that never quite healed from when a water rat snuck a piece of broken
glass into the floating rings. I knew it was playing dirty, hitting
that old spot, but my brother was twice my size.  I was small and
could barely lift the vat I used to cook lugaw.  When you're a
weakling born into a hellhole like this, there&rsquo;s no shame in
using a dirty trick.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Let&rsquo;s go, Toto,&rdquo;
Monkey said, limping towards me, his arms suddenly held up in
surrender.  My eyes darted towards the fake spacer ID tags in his
fist.  The ones he&rsquo;d just earned from his last fight in the
floating rings.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I told you for the
thousandth time, <I>gago,</I>&rdquo; I said, coughing. I felt like
puking from an uppercut he threw into my side.  &ldquo;I never wanted
to go.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Oh
I'm the idiot?&rdquo; he asked, scratching his head in annoyance.
&nbsp;There was a gash on his left brow, from where I managed to
smack him with my skillet. &quot;I'm telling you that I can get us
out of here and you try to attack me?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I ignored him and crawled back
to the bench inside the jeepney.  It bobbed up and down under my
weight.  Monkey stayed outside, standing on top of the rubble we had
docked next to.  Behind him were the remains of what probably used to
be a shopping mall. Only the topmost floor peeked through the water.
Clothes, toys, and other junk floated up between the decay and rubble
that filled these waters.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">You
must have been hit in the head one too many times,&rdquo; I said.
&nbsp;With that, he went still. &nbsp;Making fun of his brainpower
always caught his attention. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to drag me
into the bowels of whatever damned shuttle you plan to hitch a ride
on.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He
barked out a deep laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be hard.&rdquo;
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">My blood rushed to my head, and
before my brain could even catch up with the rest of my body, I found
myself jumping out of the jeepney again and lunging at him.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You can't make me do
squat!&quot;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">My fists ended nowhere, and he
dodged me easily even with his bad leg.  I hated him even more, and
my fury made me see white.  Monkey barely talked, yet his cocky
expression never let me forget that he was the one in charge.  He was
the elder.  Mama&rsquo;s words boomed in my mind: <I>Listen to your
kuya</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You're right,&quot; he
said.  &ldquo;And why should I? We&rsquo;re done here.&rdquo;  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">With that, he shoved me into the
filthy waters.  I've fallen in many times, but it did not get better
with each incident.  I could sense dead things against my skin.  The
steaming, rotting stench surged up my nostrils and made me gag.  The
waters were so thick that I was being pushed to the surface, yet I
could feel death and decay just underneath my toes, wanting to pull
me under.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I reached out and grabbed the
back of his ankle as he turned to leave.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&quot;You think you'd get very
far up there in the space colonies doing the shit jobs?&quot; I
laughed.  &quot;They'll never let you get on those starships.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I saw the tic in his jaw, and I
winced, readying for another blow.  None came.  I thought I could
predict his next move after all these years watching him in the
floating rings, but I guess it&rsquo;d been a while since I&rsquo;ve
been to his fights. He was twelve when he first started.  Back then,
he was just a human punching bag.  He was forced to face men twice
his age.  I vomited in terror after witnessing his first few fights,
and he would have to pat my back as I dry-heaved over the water,
while his face was still bloody.  I would have died a long time ago
if it wasn't for Monkey improving year after year, until he became
the best, and all bets were placed on him.  In the past couple of
years, we never had to worry about starving. Yet he never held any of
this over my head.    </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">There&rsquo;s no reason I should
ever cross him after all he&rsquo;s done, but all this just made me
shake and want to fling more things at him.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Anything will be better
than here,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the jeepney that was already
too small for both of us.  It&rsquo;s been our home all our lives,
and we were once small enough to play tag inside.  Our mother found
it amidst mountains of scrap heap and fixed it up to float.  It was a
gaudy chrome vehicle with trinkets on the side and hood that used to
bus people from one place to another when this part of the watery
wastes was Metro Manila.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">We belong here,&rdquo; I
said.  &ldquo;We were born here.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He never said much. When he was
not fighting, Monkey spent most of his time stargazing, trying to
find the twinkling light of the space stations and Mars.  That's
where all the people had gone after the islands were swallowed up by
the sea hundreds of years ago.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Last chance, Toto&rdquo;
he frowned, staring at the sludge dripping down my face, as I climbed
back onto a flat surface that used to be an awning.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Go to hell.&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He looked down, his mouth pulled
tight.  He took the glider from the roof of the jeepney, and without
another word, sped off.  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Still
dizzy, I went back into the jeepney.  It did not take much for it to
look like a disaster. I panicked after Monkey charged at me during
the fight, and grabbed for anything within hands reach. The whole
interior was coated with all of my spices. &nbsp;I hung up the pots
that were turned over, and held my breath as I tested the burner.  I
sighed with relief when the flame appeared. &nbsp;Mama was the one
who built the jeepney to float. &nbsp;She knew how everything worked,
and would have been the only one who could fix it.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">On
the side opposite of the kitchen, all of my things were scattered
throughout the floor. &nbsp;My mildewy comic books, black vinyl
records, and dozens of discolored action figures were everywhere. My
favorite, a man that looked like a lion, lay with his plastic arm
outstretched in a puddle of soup.  Monkey found it a long time ago
and gave it to me on my seventh birthday. &nbsp;I propped the lion
man back up on a stack of books. &nbsp;I held up what was left of the
hammock that Monkey and I took turns sleeping on. &nbsp;There was a
tear that stretched to either side from when his massive body went
through the fabric during the fight.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">After cleaning the soup off the
floor, I made sure to heat up a new vat of lugaw.  I added a sack of
rice and clean tank water into the drum, topped it off with some
salt, and put the burner on low.  In an hour, the air would be filled
with the smell of warm rice porridge.  My customers got irritable
when there wasn&rsquo;t a batch ready to be served, and I knew they&rsquo;d
be coming soon. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I swung onto the roof from the
driver&rsquo;s side. &nbsp;I washed up using water from our tank
reserves. &nbsp;Crouching down, I faced the coop that held our last
remaining chicken. &nbsp;It clucked at me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">You gotta back me up next
time,&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;We only have each other now.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The jeepney swayed gently under
my feet. &nbsp;I looked out at the expanse. &nbsp;A brown sea
overflowing with garbage, half-sunken buildings, and decay surrounded
me. &nbsp;For sixteen years, I&rsquo;ve stared at the same stagnant
waters. &nbsp;It was easy to identify the murky trail where he had
gone off on his glider. &nbsp;His wake cut through the muck, snaking
around the filthy waters, towards the horizon. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Pain
curled up inside my chest. &nbsp;Not because I regretted throwing
those insults at him. &nbsp;Definitely not because I just took the
worst beating in living memory.  It&rsquo;s because Monkey&rsquo;s
departure felt normal and expected.  Family came and went.  Even Mama
ran away.  In the watery wastes, no one stayed too long in your life,
and Monkey was never supposed to stick around, making sure a weakling
like me survived.</FONT></P>

mining, goddamn factories!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Tom was in one of his fits, just
as he and other customers drifted in towards the jeepney.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">His voice always quivered,
mostly spouting nonsense that no one ever understood.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Landslides, earthquakes,
storms, all because of them,&rdquo; he whined, pointing to the sky,
spittle dripping from the sides of his lips. &ldquo;Now they live in
a floating castle. And we get to eat their scraps!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Scraps or not, you still
gotta eat with your mouth closed,&rdquo; I warned him.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He loved to eat his lugaw with
fried garlic on top. &nbsp;Every time I sprinkled some, he would call
me stingy then bang his bowl against the counter until I added more. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Flor took a seat next to Tom.
&nbsp;She cruised in a tiny pirogue that she rigged with a fast
motor. &nbsp;Flor survived out in the watery wastes by entertaining
different men, although she hosted the occasional spacer. &nbsp;She
preferred to have the works on her lugaw: a hardboiled egg, chicken
and ground peanuts all doused in soy sauce. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Monkey&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo;
I muttered. &nbsp;Her shoulders slumped down at the news. I poured
<I>alak</I> for her from a steel jug.  She picked up her cup and
downed half of it, slamming it against the counter with a gasp.  I
went on to fill my own cup, and drank it all in one swig. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This is just another
Monkey-Toto Brawl,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back
for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&quot;Who cares?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Her eyes narrowed as I refilled
my cup. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">What?&rdquo; I asked.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">She reached over the counter to
run her hand through my matted hair, just like she did when I was
younger.  I swatted it off. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This will blow over,&rdquo;
she said, her voice harsh.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Flor knew Mama from the Pile: a
floating island of garbage and scrap metal where hundreds of people
lived. &nbsp;They were born there and grew up together, almost like
sisters, but they were separated when pirates raided the Pile, like
they do every year.  They took Flor along with dozens of other girls.
 Shortly after that, Mama left the Pile with the jeepney she rebuilt.
 They found each other years later when Flor approached the jeepney,
drawn to the smell of the lugaw Mama and I cooked for people. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Monkey&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;
Tom shrieked, his voice hoarse. &nbsp;Food dribbled past his jawline,
and reached his bony chest. &nbsp;His body shook. &nbsp;He knocked
his bowl aside, and shoved his head and most of his torso into the
jeepney&rsquo;s side window. He looked inside, his eyes bulging as he
scanned the interior, as if my huge brother would be able to hide in
some dark corner. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Shut up!&rdquo; I shoved
him out of my jeepney.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Calm down, Tom,&rdquo;
Flor yelled over the noise, pulling him back to his seat, and
thumping him on the shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why do you hate spacers so
much? They try, don&rsquo;t they? I heard they&rsquo;re planning on
coming down earthside to fix things.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Bullshit,&rdquo; he
blubbered, snot coming down from his nose. &nbsp;&ldquo;All bullshit.
 Always the same. &nbsp;They ruin everything...try to fix their
mess...then ruin everything even more!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He started to weep again, his
shoulders heaving up and down.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">George, sat in his usual spot to
my right.  He was a traveling projectionist, and his family used to
own a small movie theater before the islands were swallowed whole.
They&rsquo;ve been passing down the trade for generations, and&nbsp;the
oversized projector rigged to his boat, as well as the reels he
lugged around, have been with his family since they opened that
little theater now deep underwater.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He moved through the watery
wastes on a trimaran, showing movies on the side of sunken buildings
or against the sails of his vessel. &nbsp;People came from all parts
to watch a movie. For a bowl of simple lugaw with no toppings, Monkey
and I got to watch whatever movie we liked, and we&rsquo;ve always
pick the same thing: <I>Enter the Dragon</I>. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve seen
it about a hundred times.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">They&rsquo;re whining
because my brother&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; I blurted out to George,
trying to sound indifferent, but failing.  &ldquo;Apparently my
presence is not enough.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">George

 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I belong here,&rdquo; I

a real pain in the ass aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; he laughed, slapping
his thighs. &nbsp;He was sitting on top of a trailer. &ldquo;Do you
have something else stupid to say?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">How
did you get so many sacks of rice?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He
shrugged.</FONT></P>

they&rsquo;ll forget about the people they left behind,&rdquo; he
said after a while with a sobering look, &ldquo;and those rations
will stop coming.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">What

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I dare you ask more
stupid questions,&rdquo; he spat.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">My
cousin was able to work up there,&rdquo; a boy piped in. &ldquo;He
got assigned to be a feeder in a generation ship.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I
heard he gets paired up with dozens of different girls,&rdquo; Pock&rsquo;s
second added. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sounds like the life to me!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I turned around to find the
second thrusting his hips back and forth. &nbsp;They all broke out in
laughter, but I stayed quiet.  Advancing humanity or no, the idea of
making babies just to keep a ship going sounded miserable.  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When the ship finally
makes it across the stars to a new planet,&rdquo; the boy said,
frowning, &ldquo;my cousin will be long dead.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">His

Pock said. &nbsp;&ldquo;If they even make it.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I heard when someone

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">All the while the spacers
get to sleep in ice until the ship gets there,&rdquo; Pock said
bitterly. &nbsp;&ldquo;And when your cousin&rsquo;s

for the spacers.&rdquo; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Here, we live for
ourselves!&rdquo; the second yelled.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">They all cheered and banged
their bowls against the rusty deck as I brought out dessert.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">What is that?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">It&rsquo;s chocolate
cake,&rdquo; I said.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Pock scooped a piece out of the
pan with his hand, crumbs falling all over the deck. &nbsp;He took a
bite and grew quiet. &nbsp;Something entered his expression. &nbsp;He
closed his eyes and started chewing slowly, savoring each bite. The
crew converged towards me in a rush of noise and fighting. &nbsp;Someone
fell to the ground with a cut lip, just as a flurry of hands dove
into the pan. &nbsp;It was gone in seconds.  After dinner, they
rubbed their distended bellies with wonder, unused to the feeling of
fullness.  They crawled back to their trailers, their snores echoing
against the hollow metal walls.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">After that night, they locked me
in the kitchen for three days. &nbsp;They did not let me out once,
not even to serve them food, no matter how much I yelled. &nbsp;I
eventually had to find a way out.  I picked at the old, rotting lock
with a metal skewer I found in a drawer. &nbsp;When I managed to
break through, it was still a few hours before sunrise. &nbsp;The
whole ship was pitch black.  I checked every level for Vi, but had no
luck. &nbsp;I found a blaster leaning against the wall and took it.
When I reached the main deck, I froze at the sound of conversation
and a gentle whirring.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">You
only have nineteen children here.&rdquo; It was an older male voice,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
get your undies in a twist,&rdquo; Pock said. &nbsp;&ldquo;One of my
boys tweaked too hard and died, so I picked up an extra body on my
way back.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I still cannot understand
why you let them use inhalants.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I do my job, you do
yours,&rdquo; Pock said.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been happy with my
system so far, haven&rsquo;t you? I take in these boys to help me
gather warm bodies for your ships, and when they&rsquo;ve done their
time, I send them off to you too.  If I save notes here and there
letting them sniff instead of eat, all the better.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I
peeked from behind a trailer and saw a compact air shuttle idling on
the deck. &nbsp;There were dozens of spacers standing in line,
wearing white uniforms with the Amalgamated Space Colonies logo
emblazoned on their back. &nbsp;An unconscious kid was in each
person&rsquo;s arms, as they marched into the shuttle. &nbsp;But
before they went through the bay doors, someone in a lab jacket
injected a blue liquid at the base of each kid&rsquo;s skull. &nbsp;Pock
stood next to a man in white. &nbsp;Vi stood on the man&rsquo;s other
side.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I
walked towards them, blaster pointed at Pock.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">At
the sight of me, the people shuffled behind the bay doors, while Vi
and the man who looked to be her superior faced me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Pock
only laughed. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t
look at me,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the ones that
want the bodies to fill those ships.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Vi
stepped forward and held her hands up.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Toto,&rdquo;
she said, her bright eyes locking with mine. &nbsp;&ldquo;Put that
down.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">No!&rdquo;
I screamed again, aiming the blaster at her. &ldquo;Let them go!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The
man next to her drew a small silver cylinder with the flick of his
wrist, and a bolt of light shot out of it. &nbsp;I froze in place.
Someone ran out from the hatch and tackled me to the floor, while
another yanked the blaster from my grip. &nbsp;I had lost all feeling
to my limbs.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">See,
now? This is why reconditioning is vital when it comes to these
savages,&rdquo; the man muttered to Vi, as if he was just continuing
an earlier conversation.  &ldquo;Like rabid dogs, honestly.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Yes, sir.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Hoy!&rdquo; Pock yelled
out, interrupting their conversation.  One of the spacers just
dropped a boy.  &ldquo;Careful!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">There was a pause.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Are you serious?&rdquo;
asked the man.  &ldquo;You were the one that laced their food.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I felt sick at hearing this.
Pock had insisted that he be the one to serve the lugaw to his crew a
few days ago. The only reason I was conscious was because I served
myself.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Look, I know they won&rsquo;t
remember their life here, either way,&rdquo; Pock said.  &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t want them getting knocked around like that!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Vi,&rdquo; said the man,
kneeling over me.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s please not keep Pock waiting
and disperse the adequate funds to him, while I introduce the
reconditioning serum for this one here.&rdquo; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Pock laughed.  &ldquo;You know
me too well.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Of course.  You have been
my best body gatherer these past few years,&rdquo; the man said. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m just doing a
service to these people.  This place is filthy and depressing,&rdquo;
Pock rattled on.  &ldquo;These boys are lucky they&rsquo;ll get out
before the storms come.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldqldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Father,&rdquo;
Vi said, approaching.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please let me inject the serum.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Vi,&rdquo; I called out
to her, pleading.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Don&rsquo;t be silly,
darling,&rdquo; the man said under his breath.  &ldquo;You have been
acting very <I>odd</I> lately.  Do remind me to schedule you for
psychiatric evaluation when we return.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">He
pushed her aside, and the man rolled me to my back. &nbsp;From the
corner of my eye, I saw him pull out a syringe with the same blue
liquid used on the other kids. &nbsp;I felt a pinprick, but it
stopped. &nbsp;Suddenly, there was the sound of boot colliding
against flesh, then bones cracking. &nbsp;It was followed by multiple
shots firing in the air. &nbsp;I saw a flurry of legs running in
every direction. &nbsp;I felt something pull me up, and my head
lolled to my side to find Vi, blood all over her white suit, holding
the blaster. &nbsp;My muscles were like jelly, and almost all my
weight was on her. &nbsp;Her father was screaming, both hands
gripping his bloody leg, while two other spacers were on the ground
nearby, wounds blooming on their arm and shoulder.  Pock was rocking
back and forth on the floor, his hand bloody.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I was doing those water
rats a favor!&rdquo; he screamed to me.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
else for them here!&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Vi dragged me through the maze
of trailers.  We stood briefly at the edge of the deck, before
jumping onto the roof of a hydrofoil. &nbsp;It was a larger model
than the one she operated. I was reeling with questions, but the
blood on her was the only thing I could see.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Vi,&rdquo; my tongue felt
heavy.  I went in and out of consciousness.  &ldquo;A-Are you
alright?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">She deposited me on the floor of
the cabin. &nbsp;I heard the gentle whirring of the hydrofoil as she
took control of it and we sped off over the water.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Not to worry,&rdquo; she
said.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my blood.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">#</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The hydrofoil began to rock
violently.  The floor came up to meet me as the vessel tipped up,
only to be dropped back again.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I must have dozed off.  I looked
through the windows to find the clouds swirling gray and black.
Lightning flashed in several directions all around us, and the sound
of the wind was deafening.  I couldn&rsquo;t hold it in anymore and I
puked on the pristine white floor.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">She looked back at me with worry
crinkling in her eyes, her palms still pressed firmly on the two
pulsating panels that were used to navigate the hydrofoil. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve
never been inside of a watercraft built by spacers. I could only
admire the sleek interior for a few seconds before I puked again.
&nbsp;Panels lit up in urgency all around me, making my vision spin.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The storm has started!&rdquo;
she yelled over the howling winds.  There was a gleam of excitement
in her eye.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I feel like someone
turned me inside out.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Your body is rejecting
the reconditioning nanos,&rdquo; she said, almost sounding impressed.
&nbsp;She let go of the controls and the hydrofoil began to navigate
itself. She came to me and knelt down, placing a blanket over my
shoulders. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
  &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">For certain people, it

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Yes,&rdquo; she said.
&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the process of turning a person into a shell
with no memory or willpower.  The perfect worker for long-term space
travel.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Oh.&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t think I could be any more nauseous. &nbsp;&ldquo;So
you mess with our heads, because you think we&rsquo;re too stupid to
think for ourselves? Because we weren&rsquo;t designed to be perfect
like you spacers?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Even
we are implanted with nanos,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Except we are
at least granted some degree of control. &nbsp;Those orphans who were
part of Pock&rsquo;s crew will likely have no autonomy. &nbsp;They
will simply be auxiliaries&mdash;physical extensions of whatever
generation ship they will be assigned to.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">That&rsquo;s
disgusting,&rdquo; I threw the blanket to the side. &nbsp;&ldquo;What
about the people who sneak into the space colonies? What about my

 </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">No,&rdquo; she said
uncertainly, her face in her hands.  &ldquo;Monkey will blend in with
the population and find work. He must. &rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">She then crumpled to the floor.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Vi!&rdquo; I pulled her
up, and held her awkwardly. She was much heavier than she looked.  I

felt stupid.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I&rsquo;m

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Disobeyed.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Why

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Terror filled her eyes.  &ldquo;I
do not wish reconditioning on my worst enemy.  It is an abhorrent

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">How could you have not
known this?&rdquo; I left her leaning against the wall, and stood,
stumbling to the other side of the wildly swaying hydrofoil, away
from her. &ldquo;There&hellip;have been people that have gone missing

obsessed with firing people into the stars?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">An image of my mother flickered
